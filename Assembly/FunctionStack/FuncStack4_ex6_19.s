@ Deliverable 1: Describe how the stmdb instruction works in myFunc.
@ Deliverable 2: Describe how the ldmia instruction works in myFunc.
@ Deliverable 3: What is the value of R0, R1, and R2 after the program runs?
@ Deliverable 4: Replace the stmdb and ldmia instructions in myFunc with the appropriate (least number) of push and pop instructions.  Show your code.
